ShortHand CSS
==========


Shorthand CSS is a collection of universally applicable, commonly used CSS functions, written in shorthand.

For example: "f" is short for "float" and "l" is short for "left", so adding a class of "fl" to your HTML will make that element float left.

ShortHand only includes styles that could be used anywhere, on any site. This includes things like floats, margin and padding, but not things like colours or graphics.
